        <p class="emphasize">Ever wanted to build a drone by yourself?</p>
        <p class="center">We will make that dream come true!</p>
        <h2>1. Getting Started</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Hardware</h3>
        <p>First, you'll need all the parts in order to assemble a drone yourself. You can purchase a kit from our <a href="/shop">shop</a>, which includes everything you need (and helps us develop new projects). If you want a bigger challenge, you can also find all the parts online, but you'll need to build the PCB and enclosure yourself.</p>
        <p>While you're eagerly waiting for you package to arrive, you should read through this article, so you'll already know what's coming next.</p>
        <h3>1.2 GitHub</h3>
        <p>All files for this project can be found on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/cloud-garage/diy-drone" target="_blank">github.com/cloud-garage/diy-drone</a>). You will have to download or clone the repository to your PC to get started.</p>
        <p>The folder structure is pretty self-explenatory, but you can still read about it in the <i>README.md</i>. Each directory also has its own readme file with all necessery explanations. You can play around with the project to become familiar with it.</p>
        <h3>1.3 Questions &amp; Help</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions or problems, feel free to comment on the bottom of this page and we'll look into your problem.</p>
        <h2>2. Hardware</h2>
        <p>This part of the tutorial covers the dirty part of building a drone üòè</p>
        <h3>2.1 Soldering</h3>
        <p>Using the plans from the GitHub repository you need to need to solder each part into place like this: </p>
        <section class="slider"><img src="pcb_soldering_01.jpg" alt="Soldering parts on a PCB"/><img src="pcb_soldering_02.jpg" alt="Soldering parts on a PCB"/></section>
        <p>Look up a tutorial online if you're having problems and don't worry if you mess it up the first time, we've included a second PCB in the kit, just in case üòá</p>
        <p class="emphasize">Note: Wait with plugging the Arduino into the headers, until you're finished soldering.</p>
        <h3>2.2 Attaching components</h3>
        <p>Next you'll have to place the motors and the PCB inside the enclosure of the drone like this:</p>
        <section class="slider"><img src="case_01.jpg" alt="Mounting the PCB in the enclosure"/><img src="case_02.jpg" alt="Mounting the motors in the enclosure"/></section>
        <p>Now you'll only have to connect the wires:</p>
        <section class="slider"><img src="wires.jpg" alt="Connecting wires"/></section>
        <h2>3 Software</h2>
        <p>Now we get to the programming part</p>
        <h3>3.1 Setting up Arduino IDE</h3>
        <p>To get started you'll need to download the Arduino IDE from <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software" target="_blank">Arduino.cc</a>.</p>
        <p>Also, you'll have to install </p>
        <h3>3.2 Programming the Arduino</h3>
        <p>Connect your Arduino to your PC. and open <i>DIY_DRONE.ino</i>. Maybe you'll have to choose your board under <i>Tools &gt; Board &gt; Arduino Nano w/ ATmega328</i></p>
        <p>Now you'll only have to press the upload button and the program will be uploaded within a few seconds.</p>

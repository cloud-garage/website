                h2 1. Getting Started
                h3 1.1 Hardware
                p
                    | First, you'll need all the parts in order to assemble a drone yourself. You can purchase a kit from our 
                    a(href="/shop") shop
                    | , which includes everything you need (and helps us develop new projects). If you want a bigger challenge, you can also find all the parts online, but you'll need to build the PCB and enclosure yourself.
                p
                    | While you're eagerly waiting for you package to arrive, you should read through this article, so you'll already know what's coming next.
                h3 1.2 GitHub
                p
                    | All files for this project can be found on GitHub (
                    a(href="https://github.com/cloud-garage/diy-drone", target="_blank") github.com/cloud-garage/diy-drone
                    | ). You will have to download or clone the repository to your PC to get started.
                p
                    | The folder structure is pretty self-explenatory, but you can still read about it in the <i>README.md</i>. Each directory also has its own readme file with all necessery explanations. You can play around with the project to become familiar with it.
                h3 1.3 Questions &amp; Help
                p
                    | If you have any questions or problems, feel free to comment on the bottom of this page and we'll look into your problem.
                h2 2. Hardware
                p
                    | This part of the tutorial covers the dirty part of building a drone üòè
                h3 2.1 Soldering
                p
                    | Using the plans from the GitHub repository you need to need to solder each part into place like this: 
                section.slider
                    img(src="pcb_soldering_01.jpg", alt="Soldering parts on a PCB")
                    img(src="pcb_soldering_02.jpg", alt="Soldering parts on a PCB")
                p
                    | Look up a tutorial online if you're having problems and don't worry if you mess it up the first time, we've included a second PCB in the kit, just in case üòá
                p.emphasize
                    | Note: Wait with plugging the Arduino into the headers, until you're finished soldering.
                h3 2.2 Attaching components
                p
                    | Next you'll have to place the motors and the PCB inside the enclosure of the drone like this:

                p
                    | Now you'll only have to connect the wires:

                h2 3 Software
                p
                    | Now we get to the programming part
                h3 3.1 Setting up Arduino IDE
                p
                    | To get started you'll need to download the Arduino IDE from 
                    a(href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software", target="_blank") Arduino.cc
                    | .
                p
                    | Also, you'll have to install 
                h3 3.2 Programming the Arduino
                p
                    | Connect your Arduino to your PC. and open <i>DIY_DRONE.ino</i>. Maybe you'll have to choose your board under <i>Tools &gt; Board &gt; Arduino Nano w/ ATmega328</i>
                p
                    | Now you'll only have to press the upload button and the program will be uploaded within a few seconds.
